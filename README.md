Otto Group Product Classification Challenge
##### Some notes:
- Stacking ensemble performed better than single model.
- Ensemble averaging of several models performed best.
- Weighted sum of 10 nnet models with 1-layer performed almost as good as more complex and computationally complex 3-layer deep learning models in h2o.
